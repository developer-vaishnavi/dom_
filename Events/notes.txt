Event is a change in state of Object.
Lik when we click on button or anny element of hover on it. 
Event are fired to notify code of intresting changes  that may affect after code execution. 
For example you want to do some thing when user click button

There are lot of event few are here
Mouse events (click, double click etc.)

Keyboard events (keypress, keyup, keydown)

Form events (submit etc.)

Print event & many more

We can do event handling through inline and also through JS 
inline handling will be done in HTML code which make HTML code bulky that's why we prefer JS Handling.

Event Handling in JS

node.event = ( ) => {
//handle here
}

btn.onclick = ( ) => {
console.log(“btn was clicked”);
}

// Event Objects //
It tells all the information about the event 
what was the target where you clicked every thing

div.onmouseenter = (evt) =>{
    console.log(evt);
}

//Event Listner
addEventListener

with event handling we cannot apply same event two time the second will override first one
So we can use event Listner
Here we pass the event and callBack function

btn1.addEventListener("click", ()=>{
    console.log("Clicked");
});
btn1.addEventListener("click", ()=>{
    console.log("Clicked2");
});

for the same event we can print two different msg;

removeEventListner
